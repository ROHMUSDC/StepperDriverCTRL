The fully commented CONTROL firmware in this file is used to drive the ROHM BD63720EFV Stepper Motor Driver Eval Board. It is intended for reference. There are also many additional support files on this site. These support files for the for the Stepper Motor Eval Board include the Full User Manual a getting Started Flyer, Schematics, Bill of Material, etc. 

The evaluation board has two drivers installed, the ROHM BD63720 Clock-in and the ROHM BD63876 Parallel input type. 
The BD63720 clock-driven High Performance Stepper Motor Driver is connected to an on-board LAPIS micro (ML610Q102) 
for demonstration purposes.
Each circuit can also be connected to a userâ€™s external MCU to control the driver and operate the attached stepper 
motor. Additionally, the ROHM BD63720 circuit can be controlled manually in a single step or continuous mode. The ROHM BD63720 
and ROHM BD63876 are the 2A versions of each type. Users of lower current devices will be able to use these for evaluation 
as well.
