MCU: Lapis ML610Q102

The firmware in this file is used to drive the BD63715EFV Stepper Motor Driver Eval Board 

The evaluation board has two drivers installed, the BD63720 Clock-in and the BD63876 Parallel input type. 
The BD63720 clock-driven High Performance Stepper Motor Driver is connected to an on-board LAPIS micro (ML610Q102) 
for demonstration purposes.
Each circuit can also be connected to a userâ€™s external MCU to control the driver and operate the attached stepper 
motor. Additionally, the BD63720 circuit can be controlled manually in a single step or continuous mode. The BD63720 
and BD63876 are the 2A versions of each type. Users of lower current devices will be able to use these for evaluation 
as well.
